Agenda

* Consolidating Persistance Host between Dev and Staging
* Separate VPC for production - Issues
  - Production and Staging persistence hosts cant be shared
    - Alternate: Retain public EIP and use SG to control access (not ideal)
  - Production load balancer can't be shared with staging 
    - Alternate to use mod proxy from httpd (apache)
  - Does dev also share that load balancer?
* On demand environment in staging - Separate staging VPC? Or Shared between dev and staging
* How to leverage production load balancer for staging, given it will be in a separate VPC
* Onboarding of microservices into ondemand provisioning scripts
* Review Go over Trello Board
