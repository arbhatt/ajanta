## Agenda

* Demo: CF script POC. Discuss onboarding plan
* Consolidating Persistance Host between Dev and Staging
* Separate VPC for production - Issues
  - Production and Staging persistence hosts cant be shared
    - Alternate: Retain public EIP and use SG to control access (not ideal)
  - Production load balancer can't be shared with staging 
    - Alternate to use mod proxy from httpd (apache)
  - Does dev also share that load balancer?
* On demand environment in staging - Separate staging VPC? Or Shared between dev and staging
* How to leverage production load balancer for staging, given it will be in a separate VPC
* Onboarding of microservices into ondemand provisioning scripts
* Azure vs AWS compute evaluation
* Review Go over Trello Board
* Anything else?



## Discussions

* As first step, onboard auth service into Staging Ondemand Environment. Use existing VPC. VPC seperation will be done in a later project
* Use the same DB instances. Onboarding DB into ondemand environment will be done later. 
* Some challenges while onboarding DB into an Ondemand Environment  will be data retention. Possible solutions may be EBS Volume snapshot
* Ondemand provisioning of mysql could be done with UserData functions or using custom ami with My SQL installed
* Some challenges leveraging same domain name for both staging and production were discussed if seperate VPC to be used.
