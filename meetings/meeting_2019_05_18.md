# Discussion 
* Three overall areas for platform discussed (refer presentation)
* Using Cloudformation scripts to maintain environments and infrastructure to allow 
freedom to spin off and shut down infrastructure based on need.
* Use Cloudformation scripts to create dashboards and alarms to allow replication
for any environment instance
* Initial focus will be on ability to start and shutdown environment on demand. 
This will reduce up time and possibly reduce operating cost.
* Second focus will be on automated deployment to allow Saurav to focus on useful tasks 
instead of manual repetetive tasks.
* Extend environment create scripts to generate cloudwatch dashboards and alarms.
* Create some basic dashboards before going down this path.
* Use the template xls file (gantt chart) to plan and track activities for up to date 
visualization of work scope, status etc.
* Will shadow Saurav on release steps next week
* Will build a logical diagram for Docally infra in coming week

# Concerns
* Cloudwatch dashboards and alarms will increase platform costs. Needs research to quantify
* For automated deployment ECR costs needs to be assessed.
